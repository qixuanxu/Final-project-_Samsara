# Final project_Samsara

### Inspiration

**Transhumanism** is a philosophical and intellectual movement that advocates the improvement of the human condition through the development and widespread use of cutting-edge technologies that can greatly enhance lifespan, mood and cognitive abilities, and anticipates the emergence of these technologies in the future. 

Transhumanist thinkers examine the potential benefits and dangers of emerging technologies that can overcome fundamental human limitations and the ethics of their use. 

However, we have **a negative view of transhumanist theory**, believing that even though technological developments may allow humans to transcend the limits of nature, ultimately things cannot escape the shackles of nothingness.

### Samsara
The name of our work comes from the Buddhist concept of reincarnation.

The Buddhist concept of reincarnation states that reincarnation (romanisation: samsara, meaning 'world') is the concept of rebirth and the 'circularity of all life, matter and existence', which is a fundamental belief of most Indian religions.

In layman's terms, it is the cycle of birth and death, and Samsara is sometimes referred to by the terms or phrases karmic cycle, reincarnation or Punarjanman, and the 'aimless drifting, wandering or cyclical nature of worldly existence'.

### Three spaces in project
We have created three spaces.

**The first** of which represents the emptiness and imbalance of the world. 
![Space_1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91987208/174836950-3cbf5d4d-29c3-47c6-9e55-7ecbba218f9c.jpg)

**The second** space represents the inseparable relationship between man and machine in the future world.

**The third** space represents a kind of biological primordial, a scene of the beginning of the world. When the player participates in the game, he finds that these three worlds actually **create a cycle**, beginning and ending with each other. Life takes on different faces and forms as it continues to go through the cycle.

### The part of the team I am responsible for
Based on the different faces of the world presented in these three spaces, I used TouchDesigner to create animated images of different concepts to set the overall mood of the environment and to express the core concept of the work.

In the first space, I used TD's particle effects to create a circular, abstract animation effect that represents the core concept of the cycle and suggests the end of the main game line for the player - a temporary end means a new beginning.

In the second space, humans and robots are identified as the same objects in the animation, and the line between man and machine is very thin. In addition, when viewing the screens on the walls of this space, a semantically unclear speech is heard. I intercepted the AI's speech and the human speech to synthesize this speech, trying to make the audience experience the cooperation and imbalance between human and machine in this world environment.

In the third space, the screens show the rebirth of plants and flowers in their natural environment, but this process is gradually transformed into the texture of electric waves, suggesting the homogenisation of the world environment after the unrestricted use of technology and the loss of life's original vitality.
